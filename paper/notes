Methods:
  EM:
    Multinoulli mixture
    BIC

  kmed:
    Distance metric

  Dataset: 17 tumors from Train 63
    Phylogenetic reconstruction done using randomly chosen subset of 5k mutations for each
      Any variant in non-normal CN reginos rejected, as these would skew VAFs needed for reconstrcution

  All code available on GH

  Background:
    Fig: example tree with SNV and CNV counts [proposal]
    Fig: uncertainty in tree structure [retreat -- three figures -- a, b, c]
    Fig: "seeing forest for the trees" [retreat]
    Fig: four possible mutation structures [fig, table -- a, b]

  Methods:
    Flow chart showing mutpairs_{all,training,test}

  Results:
    Tables:
      Prob of data for each method, for each K
      Mean # of unique trees per cluster, for each K
      With fixed K=3, members/cluster
    Figures:
      One dataset's cluster:
        Medioiod + all unique trees in cluster
      One dataset:
        All medioids

  Result (ideas):
    All mutpairs:
      Number of members per cluster
      Number of unique trees per cluster
      Example medioid for each cluster
        And maybe similar trees for each medioid
    Training/test mutpairs:
      Likelihood of recapitulating data under model
